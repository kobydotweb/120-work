[Algorithm  Sketch](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-6/index.html)

This week, we learned how different math operations work in `p5` such as addition, subtraction, division, and modulos. We briefly learned how to translate binary, and how to map one variable to another. Regarding values, we learned how to constrain and create random numbers, which has many applications. For my homework, I created a space of triangles which all respond algorithmically to the position of `MouseX` and `MouseY` in different ways, forming an overall structure of movement. I wasn't able to figure out how to incorporate modulos or other styles of division, but I much enjoy how the sketch turned out.
