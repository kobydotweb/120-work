This week, I learned the fundamental functions of animation, loops, and frame rate. The first aspect of this was creating `draw` loops, then defining and utilizing variables such as `mouseX` and `mouseY` in conjunction with motion. We covered how to declare a frame rate for animation and how to make `let` statements as a way to give your code early instructions to be carried throughout the rest. To complete the assignment, I used the sample spinny man to center objects with the mouse and let the spin along with the X or Y mouse axis. I did not have any major problems apart from a deeper understanding of these concepts. There is nothing specific I'd like to learn more about this week.
