[Triangle Sketch (Based on Ball)](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-7/index.html)

Here is what is going on in the original code from my understanding. In line 3, we establish `ball` as a unit to which we can assess parameters. These are stated in line 4 - 10 (width, position, scale). In line 12, we create the canvas, and in line 19 we finally establish the `draw` function which leads to logical statements. To my understanding, lines 21 and 22 determine that through time, the ball object will move through the canvas, and the `if` statements determine the slight route change when the mouse is clicked. Then, we create the actual ball and state that the change will occur when the mouse is pressed.
