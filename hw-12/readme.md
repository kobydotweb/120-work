[Interacting Objects Sketch](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-12/index.html)



This week, I learned both how to add complexity to the file structure of a sketch and how to make objects within a canvas interact with each other. For my sketch, I adhered to the logic that balls would be spawned at a random `x` and `y` value, then would move both laterally and longitudinally in a random direction, changing colors if their paths cross. To achieve this, I used the `ballClass` that creates the balls' position, movement and checks if its edges cross those of other balls. The final effect resembles an abstract time-lapse view of outer space in an alternate dimension.
