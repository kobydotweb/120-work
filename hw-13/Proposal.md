Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to create a maximalist overload. This will likely take the form of a web page that is full of images. These images will be structured as moving bubbles on the X and Y axis, will move and change into other photos when clicked, forming a never ending cycle. This may sound like a dinky screensaver, but I can assure you that it is not… a non-interactive screensaver! The influence for this idea came from an album release called RED BURNS by Standing On The Corner. While the original release website has been taken down, some screenshots are attached below. I admire the boldness and originality of this single-function website. I don’t hope to match the content, but the crowded aesthetic while having my bubbles move and change. For best execution, I will need to utilize some sort of image-switching mechanism upon clicking. I will also need to determine a display method that is both random and reliable when executed. My deadline is, of course, December 11th at 8:00am.
