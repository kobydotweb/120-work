###### Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.

This week, we learned how to use Github applications for organization and uploading, how to use markdown language styles, and what differentiates markdown from other text editor styles.

I learned how to link a [website](https://www.kobysilverman.com),  how to make an ordered

###### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

I followed each step of each page along with `Github Desktop` and `Atom`.

###### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

My only problems were understanding and navigating the web-like infrastructure between Atom, Github Desktop, Github's website, and the class' Github repo. If this assignment is submitted, it means I overcame the confusion.

###### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

Not particularly.

###### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?

None.
