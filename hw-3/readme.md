["Hello World!" Sketch](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-3/index.html)



This week, I learned some of the fundamental functions of p5 and basics of how `html` works. I learned how to create a canvas to work from, change the background color, link an `html` file to a `p.5 sketch`, and use an `index.html` file. I followed the steps carefully to create my `p.5 sketch` with a pink "Hello World!", choosing to relocate the text carefully as to be near equidistant from the bottom and right side edge of the canvas. The main issue I ran into was during the process of loading my `p.5 sketch` in the `index.html` directory of the website. After reorganizing my folder system in `120-work`, I realized the problem. I had a folder titled "week-3" that contained my sketch, whereas my hw-3 folder contained only an "index.html" file. I did not post to my classmates or receive any info this week, I simply used logic and persistence to solve my problems. I hope this knowledge of canvases will begin the process of creating more visual displays and interaction next week!
