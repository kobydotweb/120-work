This week, I learned how to draw using `p5`. I followed along with each instructional page, playing with the code examples. My main problems were simply memorizing each numeral parameter for functions like `translate`, `rotate`, and `scale`. I solved these by playing and playing some more. My self-portrait utilized the Michael Musick code example as a starting point, and built from there. I did not post anything to the issue tracker, nor receive help from classmates. The main thing I could use further discussion on is how to incorporate drawing and animation with sound (which I'm sure I will learn later).
