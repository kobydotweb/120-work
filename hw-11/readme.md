[OOP Light Rays Sketch](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-11/index.html)



This week, I learned how Object Oriented Programming works, the terminology involved and what makes it different from classic "sequential" programming. I learned that a `class` contains information like `properties` and `methods`. I also learned how to `instantiate` objects with `.new` and how to refer to the encapsulating object with `.this`. For this week's sketch, I created an object titled `Circles` and used `constructor` to declare the `x`, `y`, and `r` variables that would determine position, show and move the circles. I created a triangle that begins in the top left corner of the window that follows the circles to create the illusion of planets in space or rays of light developing against black. I did not ask any students for help!
