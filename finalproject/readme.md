[`Triangle Function Sketch`](https://kobydotweb.github.io/120-work/hw-10/index.html)

This week, we learned how to create our own functions instead of using the library functions established by `p.5`. We learned how to define functions, set input parameters for custom functions, and return data from them. For the sketch, I used the shapes of triangles from a long ago sketch, but created a custom function `Shape` to create the triangles themselves. This required the use of `push` and `pop` to create the sandbox.
